### MLB Attendance Determination ###

## Problem Statement: ##

Using data on the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball (MLB) team located here: dodgers.csv to make a recommendation to management on how to improve attendance. 

## Summary of Analysis ##

* There were 15 games that amassed over 50,000 fans in attendance for Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games. April and August were the two months that had the 2 highest fan attendance: • April 10:
56000 attendants • August 21: 56000 attendants Although April and August had the highest attendance day recorded, based on the boxplot analysis conducted, attendance is overall higher in the
summer months. This is true because the median value for summer months were higher than the median of value of spring and fall months.

* The other boxplot analysis conducted was to determine which day of the week drew the most attendance. The results indicate that Tuesdays tend to be the preferred day to attend a Dodgers baseball
game. The median value of 52,000 is approximately 9000 more than the closest median value of Thursdays. Not surprisingly, Mondays were the worst days to attend a game.

* When looking at which opponents brought in the largest crowd, the boxplot analysis indicates that on average when the opponents are the Angels, Mets, and Nationals attendance is usually optimal.
This is understandable because the Angels are one of the Los Angeles Dodgers rivals. The Angels/Dodgers games averaged approximately 50,000 attendants a game.

* When it comes to weather, there does not seem to be much of a correlation between the outlook of the skies. Temperatures on the other hand, show some positive correlation according to the scatterplot analysis. Temperatures that were generally between 70 and 80 degrees accrued the best attendance.

* Finally, the promotional items of shirts, fireworks, and bobbleheads all had a positive correlation in regards to attendance. The bobblehead promotion seems to really have a positive effect on drawing
crowds to the Dodgers games.

## Recommendation ##

If the management team has control of the scheduling of games, I would advise them to schedule more games in the summer and on Tuesdays if possible. Try to avoid Monday afternoon games, as attendance would be low for that time. Not much I can advise about the weather, as we all know weather has a mind of its own. I would also advise the team to increase the number of promotional items  such as bobbleheads and t-shirts to assist in drawing in more crowd. Think outside the box and promote other items such as baseballs, miniature bats, half off food items, etc. Experiment and see what sticks because we already know promotional items have a positive effect on attendance.
