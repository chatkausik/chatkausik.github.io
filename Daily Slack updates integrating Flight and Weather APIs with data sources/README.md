## Abstract ##
In modern application development, integrating data from diverse sources in various formats is a common challenge, especially in the realm of machine learning applications. 
Apache NiFi presents a powerful solution for seamlessly orchestrating data flow between different systems. This project demonstrates how Apache NiFi can be leveraged to 
collect data from two distinct APIs - aviationstack.com for real-time flight data and visualcrossing.com for weather data - and subsequently write this data to multiple 
databases while also sending daily notifications to Slack. The project provides a step-by-step research guide on setting up data ingestion, transformation, and dissemination 
pipelines using Apache NiFi processors.

## Conclusion: ##
This project illustrates the versatility of Apache NiFi in orchestrating complex data flows across heterogeneous systems. 
By leveraging Apache NiFi processors and services, developers can efficiently integrate data from disparate sources, transform 
it as needed, and distribute it to multiple destinations, all within a unified and visually intuitive interface. Furthermore,
the real-time notification capabilities provided by Apache NiFi enable proactive monitoring and alerting, enhancing overall 
system observability and responsiveness.
