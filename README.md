## Projects
### Fraud Detection for Transactions ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Fraud%20Detection%20For%20Transactions)

Development of a machine learning model to predict whether a financial transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
The Fraud Company aims to enhance its fraud detection service in the Brazilian market. With a revenue-sharing model heavily dependent on correct fraud detection, the company faces significant financial risk if its models are not precise. This project aims to mitigate this risk by building a robust machine learning model capable of accurately finding fraudulent transactions. 

### Daily Slack updates integrating Flight and Weather APIs with data sources ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Daily%20Slack%20updates%20integrating%20Flight%20and%20Weather%20APIs%20with%20data%20sources)

In modern application development, integrating data from diverse sources in various formats is a common challenge, especially in the realm of machine learning applications. Apache NiFi presents a powerful solution for seamlessly orchestrating data flow between different systems. This project demonstrates how Apache NiFi can be leveraged to collect data from two distinct APIs - aviationstack.com for real-time flight data and visualcrossing.com for weather data - and subsequently write this data to multiple databases while also sending daily notifications to Slack. The project provides a step-by-step research guide on setting up data ingestion, transformation, and dissemination pipelines using Apache NiFi processors.


### Retail Inventory Management ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/main/Retail%20Inventory%20Management)

Goal: Building a binary classifier which gives us a list of product ID which need to retained in the inventory or list of products that need to be removed
Context: A retail firm has many products in their inventory, and very few of them tend to sell (only about 10% sell each year) and many of the products only have a single sale in the course of a year
Objective: The sales and growth team of the retail firm wants to determine which products from their inventory should they retain to sell and the ones to discard 
Data: The data given contains both historical sales data AND active inventory
