## Data Science Projects
### Fraud Detection for Transactions ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Fraud%20Detection%20For%20Transactions)

Development of a machine learning model to predict whether a financial transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.The Fraud Company aims to enhance its fraud detection service in the Brazilian market. With a revenue-sharing model heavily dependent on correct fraud detection, the company faces significant financial risk if its models are not precise. This project aims to mitigate this risk by building a robust machine learning model capable of accurately finding fraudulent transactions.

### Daily Slack updates integrating Flight and Weather APIs with data sources ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Daily%20Slack%20updates%20integrating%20Flight%20and%20Weather%20APIs%20with%20data%20sources)

In modern application development, integrating data from diverse sources in various formats is a common challenge, especially in the realm of machine learning applications. Apache NiFi presents a powerful solution for seamlessly orchestrating data flow between different systems. This project demonstrates how Apache NiFi can be leveraged to collect data from two distinct APIs - aviationstack.com for real-time flight data and visualcrossing.com for weather data - and subsequently write this data to multiple databases while also sending daily notifications to Slack. The project provides a step-by-step research guide on setting up data ingestion, transformation, and dissemination pipelines using Apache NiFi processors.

### Artist identification from their Paintings. ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/Second-Capstone-Project)

Artist identification is traditionally performed by art historians and curators who have expertise and familiarity with different artists and styles of art. This is a complex and interesting problem for computers because identifying an artist does not just require object or face detection; artists can paint a wide variety of objects and scenes.
This approach is motivated by the hypothesis that every artist has their own unique style of art and that we can improve upon existing artist identification methods by using a CNN to determine the best possible feature representation of paintings.


### Retail Inventory Management ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Retail%20Inventory%20Management)

Goal: Building a binary classifier which gives us a list of product ID which need to retained in the inventory or list of products that need to be removed.

Context: A retail firm has many products in their inventory, and very few of them tend to sell (only about 10% sell each year) and many of the products only have a single sale in the course of a year.

Objective: The sales and growth team of the retail firm wants to determine which products from their inventory should they retain to sell and the ones to discard.

Data: The data given contains both historical sales data AND active inventory.

### Movie Recommendation System ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Movie%20Reccomender%20System)

The goal of this project is to provide a recommendation system for video content providers to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies. 
Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are related to the search history of the user. 

They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other. Major companies like YouTube, Amazon, Netflix use recommendation systems in social and e- commerce sites use recommendation system for its users to suggest for an individual according to their requirement more precise and accurate. These online content and service providers have a huge amount of content so the problem which arises is which data is required for whom so the problem of providing apposite content frequently. This project represents the overview and approaches of techniques generated in a recommendation system.

### Covid 19 Data Analysis and Comparison ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Covid%2019%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Comparison)

The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious respiratory virus that first reported in Wuhan, China. On 2/11/2020, the World Health Organization designated the name COVID-19 for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. This new strain of virus has strike fear in many countries as cities are quarantined and hospitals are overcrowded. This project aims at exploring COVID-19 through data analysis and visualization.

### House Price Prediction  ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Housing%20Price%20Prediction)

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model for the prediction of housing prices based on pattern extracted from our USA_Housing dataset which contains data about USA housing sales provided by Kaggle. This dataset contains features like number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, sqft, year built, year renovated, condition, zipcode and the target variable will be price. We will use various visualization methods to analyze the correlation of each feature as part of EDA. Descriptive analysis and quantitative analysis will use subsets of it depending on models. This project consists of two phases: -

* Phase I: Focuses on data cleaning, exploration and preprocessing.
* Phase II : Machine Learning model building, validation and prediction.
