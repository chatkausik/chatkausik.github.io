## Data Science Projects
### Fraud Detection for Transactions ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Fraud%20Detection%20For%20Transactions)

Development of a machine learning model to predict whether a financial transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.The Fraud Company aims to enhance its fraud detection service in the Brazilian market. With a revenue-sharing model heavily dependent on correct fraud detection, the company faces significant financial risk if its models are not precise. This project aims to mitigate this risk by building a robust machine learning model capable of accurately finding fraudulent transactions.

### Daily Slack updates integrating Flight and Weather APIs with data sources ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Daily%20Slack%20updates%20integrating%20Flight%20and%20Weather%20APIs%20with%20data%20sources)

In modern application development, integrating data from diverse sources in various formats is a common challenge, especially in the realm of machine learning applications. Apache NiFi presents a powerful solution for seamlessly orchestrating data flow between different systems. This project demonstrates how Apache NiFi can be leveraged to collect data from two distinct APIs - aviationstack.com for real-time flight data and visualcrossing.com for weather data - and subsequently write this data to multiple databases while also sending daily notifications to Slack. The project provides a step-by-step research guide on setting up data ingestion, transformation, and dissemination pipelines using Apache NiFi processors.

### Retail Inventory Management ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Retail%20Inventory%20Management)

Goal: Building a binary classifier which gives us a list of product ID which need to retained in the inventory or list of products that need to be removed.

Context: A retail firm has many products in their inventory, and very few of them tend to sell (only about 10% sell each year) and many of the products only have a single sale in the course of a year.

Objective: The sales and growth team of the retail firm wants to determine which products from their inventory should they retain to sell and the ones to discard.

Data: The data given contains both historical sales data AND active inventory.

### Movie Recommendation ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Movie%20Reccomender%20System)

* Using several datasets to build a recommender system for movies by correlation tactics and utilization of pivot tables
1.	Load libraries
2.	Load the ratings dataset and preview the first 10 rows
3.	Load the movie titles dataset and preview the first 10 rows
4.	Merge the two dataframes into one
5.	Preview the first 10 rows of the new dataframe
6.	Create a new dataframe that displays average rating (mean) for each movie in the data
7.	Dreate a dataframe that shows the total ratings cast for each movie
8.	Calculating the Correlation by making a pivot table (rows=userID, columsns=Movie Title)
9.	Preview the first ten rows pivot dataframe
10.	Create a correlation value using the 'corrwith' function in conjunction with a movie choice
11.	Display the first five rows of computed pairwise correlation between rows and columns
12.	Create a new variable named 'recommend' and drop all the empty values
13.	Merge the ratings to the correlation table
14.	Filter all movies that are correlated to 'Godfather, The (1972)' using the sort_values function
15.	Merge the original movie dataset to show all fields
16.	Display the recommended list dataframe to include the movie selection and ten recommended movies (Nair, 2019)

The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious respiratory virus that first reported in Wuhan, China. On 2/11/2020, the World Health Organization designated the name COVID-19 for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. This new strain of virus has strike fear in many countries as cities are quarantined and hospitals are overcrowded. This project aims at exploring COVID-19 through data analysis and visualization.


### House Price Prediction  ###

[Publication](https://github.com/chatkausik/chatkausik.github.io/tree/master/Housing%20Price%20Prediction)
