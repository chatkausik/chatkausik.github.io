## Is Air-travel Safe? ##

* As I evaluate the recent media propaganda about airlines safety issues, here is what the data says. And it does not really agree with the media hype. There are roughly 3 million flights per month performed by all kinds of aircraft with great success. Given this statistics alone, one can imagine how sophisticated and safe air travel is overall. The risk of experiencing anything close to dangerous is very slim. 

* As the safety measure and technology thrives forward, 2017 was the safest year in history for commercial airlines, according to industry research. There were no passenger jets crashes anywhere in the world, as reported separately by Dutch consultancy To70 and The Aviation Safety Network. But this does not mean there were less flight. In fact, there were more flights being made than ever before. Though this  "extraordinarily" low accident rate is being labelled as both "good safety" and "good fortune", aviation death rate is in a constantly decreasing trend for the past two decades.

* A research on worldwide airlines fatalities between 1985-1999 and 2000-2014 shows an overall 42.6% decrease in number of fatalities.

## Are other travel modes safer than air? ##

* Aviation mishaps, when compared with accidents in other means of travelling, seems to be comparatively smaller problem to deal with. 

* Driving on the highway, statistically speaking, is the most dangerous way to travel. Drivers have a 1 in 114 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, and a 1 in 654 chance of dying as a car occupant. Out of the 35,092 highway fatalities in 2015, 12,628 were occupants in car, 9,813 were occupants in small trucks, and 4,976 were motorcyclists. 

* Similar research on fatalities on road accidents in the United States between 1985-1999 and 2000-2014
As an overall statistics based on 2015 data, trains had 749 fatalities, water transport had 692 boating fatalities and aviation had 444 fatalities. Compared to 848.1 million aviation passengers (only in and out of USA), airlines could be considered one of the safest travel mediums, if not the safest.

## Why does aviation catastrophe catch our attention? ##

A main reason about the media hype and public buzz on airline catastrophe is the  risk perception. Airlines accidents grab our attention, induce fear, and tend to stick in our minds, giving us the false impression that these events are common occurrences no matter how infrequently they happen. 

Part of the perception could be the scale, since one airplane crash can cause hundreds of lives; and the other part could be because in air travel, safety is completely under the flight crew and airlines' control with nothing much to do by the passengers. 


## Conclusion ##

Aviation industry is highly sophisticated, very competitive and constantly evolving. We will be amazed if we think about the emerging and evolving innovations regarding comfort and safety in the airlines space. Ranging from evolving cockpit technology, constant flight status monitoring, passenger cabin safety measures, ultra modern communication through air traffic control and airport control, security checking and airport safety, - all work together to provide a better and safer travel experience. Considering all the aspects, air travel is arguably the safest means of travelling in the present era.
